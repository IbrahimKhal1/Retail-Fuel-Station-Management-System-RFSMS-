  - **`static/`**: CSS, JavaScript, and media assets.
  - **`templates/`**: HTML templates.
  - **`config/`**: Configuration settings.
  - **`tests/`**: Unit tests for functionality validation.

### **4. Code Refactoring & Optimization**
- Simplified complex functions by breaking them into smaller, reusable functions.
- Eliminated redundant code and improved readability.
- Used **descriptive variable names** instead of generic ones (`x`, `data1`).

### **5. Improved README.md**
